# 🧠 Decentralize AI

> **Sovereign AI Network - A Network-State Protocol for Decentralized Intelligence**

## 🎯 Vision

We're not just building a tool — we're creating sovereign AI, a network-state-level protocol for decentralized intelligence that will either change the world or become one of the most significant tech movements in modern history.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Governance Model**: Constitution-based voting protocol for decentralized decision making
- **Tokenomics**: Staking mechanisms, incentive structures, and controlled inflation
- **Contributor System**: Anonymous proof-of-contribution scoring for merit-based participation
- **Federated AI**: Distributed training and inference across the network
- **DAO Infrastructure**: Decentralized autonomous organization with node bootstrap capabilities
