## Staking Mechanisms

### 1. Validator Staking

**Purpose**: Secure the network through proof-of-stake consensus

**Requirements**:

- Minimum stake: 10,000 $DAI
- Technical infrastructure: 24/7 node operation
- Reputation score: Minimum 100 points
- Uptime requirement: 99%+

**Rewards**:

- Base APY: 5%
- Performance bonus: Up to 10% additional
- Slashing protection: Insurance pool participation

**Slashing Conditions**:

- Double signing: 5% stake slashed
- Downtime: 0.1% per hour
- Malicious behavior: Up to 100% stake slashed

### 2. Contribution Staking

**Purpose**: Ensure quality and commitment to contributions

**Staking Requirements**:

- AI Training: 1,000-10,000 $DAI (based on model size)
- Data Provision: 500-5,000 $DAI (based on dataset value)
- Computational Resources: 2,000-20,000 $DAI (based on capacity)
- Research: 1,000-15,000 $DAI (based on project scope)

**Return Conditions**:

- Successful completion: 100% stake returned + rewards
- Partial completion: Proportional return + partial rewards
- Failure: Stake forfeited to network treasury
- Malicious behavior: Stake slashed + reputation penalty

## Incentive Structures

### 1. AI Training Rewards

**Model Improvement Rewards**:

```text
Reward = Base_Reward × Improvement_Multiplier × Quality_Score
```

Where:

- **Base_Reward**: 1,000-50,000 $DAI (based on model complexity)
- **Improvement_Multiplier**: 1.0-5.0 (based on performance gain)
- **Quality_Score**: 0.5-1.0 (peer-reviewed quality assessment)

**Training Efficiency Rewards**:

- Energy efficiency: 10% bonus for low-power training
- Speed optimization: 5% bonus for faster convergence
- Novel architectures: 20% bonus for innovative approaches

### 2. Data Provision Rewards

**Dataset Quality Metrics**:

- **Accuracy**: Measured against ground truth
- **Diversity**: Coverage of edge cases and scenarios
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proof of data quality
- **Freshness**: Recency and relevance of data

**Reward Calculation**:

```text
Reward = Dataset_Value × Quality_Multiplier × Privacy_Bonus
```

Where:

- **Dataset_Value**: 100-10,000 $DAI (based on size and importance)
- **Quality_Multiplier**: 0.5-2.0 (based on quality metrics)
- **Privacy_Bonus**: 1.0-1.5 (for privacy-preserving contributions)

### 3. Computational Resource Rewards

**Resource Allocation**:

- **GPU Hours**: 0.1-1.0 $DAI per hour (based on hardware)
- **CPU Hours**: 0.01-0.1 $DAI per hour (based on performance)
- **Storage**: 0.001-0.01 $DAI per GB per month
- **Bandwidth**: 0.0001-0.001 $DAI per GB transferred

**Performance Bonuses**:

- Uptime: 5% bonus for 99%+ uptime
- Latency: 10% bonus for low-latency responses
- Reliability: 15% bonus for consistent performance

### 4. Governance Participation Rewards

**Voting Rewards**:

- Active voting: 10 $DAI per proposal
- Proposal creation: 100-1,000 $DAI (based on impact)
- Community discussion: 5-50 $DAI (based on quality)
- Constitutional compliance: 25 $DAI per audit

**Delegation Rewards**:

- Delegator: 5% of delegate's governance rewards
- Delegate: 95% of governance rewards
- Performance bonus: Up to 20% for high-quality delegation

## Economic Sustainability

### 1. Deflationary Mechanisms

**Token Burning**:

- Failed contributions: 50% of staked tokens burned
- Malicious behavior: 100% of staked tokens burned
- Network fees: 10% of transaction fees burned
- Governance violations: Variable burning based on severity

**Supply Reduction**:

- Annual burn target: 1% of total supply
- Burn rate adjustment: Based on network growth
- Deflationary pressure: Increases token value over time

### 2. Treasury Management

**Treasury Allocation**:

- Research & Development: 40%
- Network Security: 25%
- Community Development: 20%
- Legal & Compliance: 10%
- Emergency Reserve: 5%
